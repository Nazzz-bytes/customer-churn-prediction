# customer-churn-prediction
This project uses machine learning in Python to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service (like telecom). The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, enabling proactive retention efforts.
Key Steps:

Data Handling:
Loads customer data (demographics, service usage, account info).
Cleans the data (handles missing values).
Prepares data for the model (encodes categories, scales numbers).
Model Building:
Splits data into training and testing sets.
Trains a Random Forest Classifier (a machine learning model).
Prediction and Evaluation:
The model predicts which customers will churn.
Model performance is measured (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
Results are visualized (ROC curve).
